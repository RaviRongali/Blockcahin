*** How to run **** 
1) seed can run using the below command
>>> python3 seed.py <port-number>
2) peer can run using any of the below commands
>>> python3 peer.py <port-number>
>>> python3 peer.py <inter-arrival-time> <port-number>
>>> python3 peer.py <ip> <port-number>
3) running adversary using below commands 
>>> python3 adversary.py <port-number>
>>> python3 adversary.py <inter-arrival-time> <%node flooded> <port-number>
>>> python3 adversary.py <inter-arrival-time> <%node flooded> <ip> <port-number>
%node flooded will take the values from 1,2,3 

Submitted Directory contains the following files
1) peer.py
2) seed.py
3) config.txt
4) adversary.py
5) Blockdiagram.py (used to generate the Blocktree.pdf)
6) Blocktree.pdf
7) README
8) Data folder
   "Data" folder contains the following files
    1) Folders of names like "x_y" where x is inter-arrival time and y is %of nodes flooded
        --- files which generated after running 10 minutes in each folder are of two types 
            1) json file showing database 
            2) log files 
    2) Graph.py is to generate the 6 plots using the above folders Data
    ----Graph Generation Process
        1. Plotted the graph from the network having 6 honest nodes and one adversary with 33% hash power
    3) Six different Plots  


A New Node does the following tasks
1) connect to peer servers
2) requests latest blockchain from one of its peer connections
3) Start mining and receives the other blocks and put it in a blockchain



***  Assumptions *** 
1. All nodes are in general honest and send their longest chain in their local blockchain 
. New Node will always request one of its connected peers to send the longest chain in his local blockchain


*****  Description about finding longest chain  ****
we started traversing the chain from highest index(which is equal to height of that block)
and then finding parent of that block using previous hash stored in the current block.
Then we do this upto genesis block. All the traversed blocks belong to longest chain

*** Block diagram ****
using graphiz package made the block diagram saved as pdf  blocktree.pdf
